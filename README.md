- **Real-time Data Access**: Read data from the blockchain instantly.
- **Customizable Agents**: Tailor agents to meet specific requirements.
- **Python Integration**: Leverage the simplicity and power of Python.
- **Open Source**: Contribute and collaborate with a growing community.

## Getting Started

To get started with Zion, you can visit our [Releases](https://github.com/Yokoi666/Zion/releases) section. Here, you will find the latest version of the software. Download the appropriate file, execute it, and you are on your way to deploying intelligent agents.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Pip (Python package installer)
- Access to the Solana blockchain

### Steps to Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yokoi666/Zion.git
   cd Zion
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the latest release from our [Releases](https://github.com/Yokoi666/Zion/releases) section. Make sure to execute the downloaded file.

## Usage

Once installed, you can create your first intelligent agent with just a few lines of code. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```python
from zion import Agent

# Create an agent
my_agent = Agent(name="MyFirstAgent")

# Set parameters
my_agent.set_parameters({
    "transaction_limit": 10,
    "data_source": "Solana",
})

# Execute the agent
my_agent.run()
```

### Advanced Usage

Zion allows for more complex setups. You can create agents that interact with multiple data sources, handle various transaction types, and even integrate with other blockchain platforms.

```python
# Advanced agent example
class CustomAgent(Agent):
    def execute_custom_logic(self):
        # Custom logic for your agent
        pass

my_custom_agent = CustomAgent(name="AdvancedAgent")
my_custom_agent.execute_custom_logic()
```
